/**
 * Playground: try new styles without think on the organization and naming,
 * for Work In Progress, BUT REMEMBER you move them to proper file linked at
 * main.scss when is stable and remove trials (this file should be empty when
 * releasing to production).
 *
 * REMEMBER: theme.scss and Boostrap variables are available (check that files for reference).
 * Overrides to global variables should be done directly at theme.scss even if just
 * testing.
