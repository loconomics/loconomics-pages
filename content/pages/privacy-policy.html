        <h2>4. When and Why We Disclose Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes
            the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do
            so. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) With affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by Loconomics) who may only use
                the Personal Information for the purposes described herein.
            </li>
            <li>
                b) With third party vendors who provide administrative, professional, financial, and communication services on our behalf,
                such as website hosting, processing and delivery mailings, providing customer support, conducting
                Background Checks, or providing credit card processing services (collectively known as “Service
                Providers”). We require such third-party Service Providers to promise to use such information
                only as necessary to provide the relevant services to us and in compliance with this Privacy
                Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                c) We may share Client Personal Information (other than credit card information) with Service Professionals. We may provide
                your Personal Information to Service Professionals when if you purchased Services from that Service
                Professional through Loconomics, or if you participated in an offer, contest or other activity
                sponsored or offered through Loconomics on behalf of the Service Professional. We may also provide
                Service Professionals with Personal Information about Clients who have purchased the Service
                Professionals' Services, to send customized offers, to validate the purchases, to aid and troubleshoot
                redemption, to combat fraud, as part of legal proceedings affecting Loconomics and the Service
                Professional, to facilitate a direct relationship between Service Professionals and Clients,
                and to enable Service Professionals to communicate electronically with Clients who purchased
                the Service Professionals' Services.

                is provided by or in conjunction with Loconomics and its Partners and in which you have elected
                to participate. For example, if you are referred to Loconomics from a Partner's website or through
                an invitation facilitated by or in conjunction with a Loconomics Partner, Loconomics may provide
                that Partner with Contact Information and Transactional Information.

            <li>
                e) To effect a merger, acquisition, or otherwise; to support the sale or transfer of business assets; to enforce our rights
                or protect our property; to protect the rights, property or safety of others, investigate fraud,
                respond to a government request; or as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate
                governance functions. We may also disclose Personal Information in litigation or a regulatory
                action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar
                legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts where we operate.
                If Loconomics is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,
                you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership
                or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal
                Information. We may also disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable.

                with reports that contain anonymized, aggregated and/or statistical data about Users.

        <h2>8. Security of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            The security of your personal information is important to us. Loconomics has implemented an information security program
            that contains administrative, technical, and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard
            Personal Information. We follow generally accepted standards to facilitate compliance with HIPAA,
            including the following technological safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to
            us, both during transmission and once we receive it:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) patient/client information and other sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) are transferred using 168-bit
                SSL encryption; accounts require secure login with minimum password length enforcement;
            </li>
            <li>
                b) the production environment is protected by stand-alone firewalls with access limited to authorized personnel via encrypted
                channels;
            </li>
            <li>
                c) and offsite backups are made daily and stored in an encrypted state.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Further, Loconomics requires all personnel with access to patient/client information for purposes of providing technical
            support to be trained in the privacy requirements of HIPAA. Loconomics does not share, sell, disclose
            or provide patient/client information to third parties unless required by law and in accordance with
            the terms of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loconomics also provides numerous settings and features—including user-specific login, multiple user access levels, and the
            ability to easily add and remove users—to facilitate procedural standards that enable you to maintain
            overall HIPAA compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
            As with any technology, it's incumbent upon you to properly incorporate Loconomics into your business practices and make
            your own assessment of your resulting overall HIPAA compliance. No method of transmission over the
            Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that such
            information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
            technical, or managerial safeguards.
