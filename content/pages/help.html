        <dt>What do you mean by member-owned?</dt>
        <dd>We're 100% owned by members like you – freelancers, 1099 workers, and licensed professionals. Not investors. That means each member shares in the profits and has the right to run for and vote for the board of directors.
            <br>
            <br>
            Legally, we're a California Cooperative Corporation. <a href="https://loconomics.gitbooks.io/loconomics-cooperative-bylaws/content/" target="blank">Our bylaws</a> ensure control and profits remain in your hands for eternity.</dd>

        <dt>What time committment is there?</dt>
        <dd>You get what you give. Active members build stronger and more profitable businesses. However, be as active or inactive as you like – you'll still maintain voting rights with your paid membership and share in profits.</dd>
        <dt>What's in the Loconomics Toolbelt?</dt>
        <dd>Member mastermind groups, online booking and scheduling, client management, earnings tracking, and an online listing. Help shape the future of the toolbelt as a member.</dd>
        <dt>How much does membership cost?</dt>
        <dd>Membership plans start at $19 monthly. All fees paid earn you cooperative patronage points (profit sharing).</dd>
        <dt>How do I get started?</dt>
