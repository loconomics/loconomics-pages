            <p>
                Loconomics empowers independent professionals with technology, shared ownership, and connections. Whatever your specialty, we've created a platform that puts you first.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're dedicated to our members, who provide helpful, creative, and meaningful services to the Bay Area and beyond.

    <p>
        Our cooperative model means that every profesional is an owner and has an equal vote in the election of the Loconomics board, consisting of fellow professionals, and in other major decisions. It also
        means that the profits generated by Loconomics will be returned to the owners, in proportion to their participation in generating profits.
