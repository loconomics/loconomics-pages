                Health Information solely:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>
                        for meeting its obligations as set forth in any agreements between the Parties evidencing their business relationship, for
                        services as described in such agreement(s), or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        as required by applicable law, rule or regulation, or by any accrediting or credentialing organization to whom Covered Entity
                        is required to disclose such information or as otherwise permitted or required under
                        this Agreement, the Arrangement Agreement (if consistent with this Agreement and the

                    <li>
                        as would be permitted by the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule if such use or disclosure were made by Covered Entity. All such

                        regarding limited data sets and 45 CFR &#167; 164.502(b) regarding the minimum necessary

                        Part 164, to comply with the requirements of Subpart E of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 that apply
                        to Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                b)
                <strong>Disposition of PHI.</strong> Upon termination of this Agreement, if feasible, Business Associate
                will return or destroy all Protected Health Information received from or created or received
                by Business Associate on behalf of Covered Entity that Business Associate still maintains in
                any form and retain no copies of such information. It may not be feasible for Business Associate
                to return or destroy all copies of Protected Health Information. In such cases, where Business
                Associate determines, in its sole discretion, that such return or destruction is not feasible,
                the Parties will extend the protections of this Agreement to the information and Business Associate
                will limit further uses and disclosures solely to those purposes as originally intended under
                this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                c)

                that create, receive, maintain, or transmit Protected Health Information on behalf of Business
                Associate agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to Business Associate with

                the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of any of such information which is Electronic
                Protected Health Information.
            </li>
            <li>

                Entity of such breach pursuant to the terms of 45 CFR &#167; 164.410 and reasonably cooperate
                in the Covered Entity&#8217;s breach analysis procedures, including risk assessment, if requested.
                A breach shall be treated as discovered by Business Associate as of the first day on which such
                breach is known to Business Associate or, by exercising reasonable diligence, would have been
                known to Business Associate. Business Associate will provide such notification to Covered Entity

                <strong>Permitted Use of PHI.</strong> Notwithstanding the prohibitions set forth in this Agreement,
                Business Associate may use and disclose Protected Health Information:

                        Parties evidencing their business relationship, or as mutually agreed in writing by both
                        Parties. For purposes of this Agreement, data aggregation services means the combining
                        of Protected Health Information by Business Associate with the protected health information
                        received by Business Associate in its capacity as a business associate of another covered

                required or permitted by applicable law. Business Associate will implement administrative, physical,
                and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity,
                and availability of any Electronic Protected Health Information that it creates, receives, maintains,
                or transmits on behalf of Covered Entity as required by the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule and
                will comply, where applicable, with Subpart C of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 with respect to such Electronic
                Protected Health Information to prevent use or disclosure of such electronic PHI other than as
                provided for by this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                g)
                <strong>Audit of Business Associate&#8217;s Records.</strong> The Secretary of Health and Human Services
                shall have the right to audit Business Associate&#8217;s records and practices related to use
                and disclosure of Protected Health Information to ensure Covered Entity&#8217;s compliance with
                the terms of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule.

        <h2>7. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <h3>No Third Parties.</h3>

            Except as expressly stated herein or within the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, the Parties to this Agreement do not intend
            to create any rights in any third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Entire Agreement, Amendments, Assignment, Relationship, Waiver, Governing Law.</h3>
        <p>
            This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties in connection with the subject matter herein and this Agreement
            may be amended or modified only in a writing signed by the Parties. Either party may assign, sublicense,
            delegate or transfer all or any portion of its rights or responsibilities under this Agreement by
            operation of law or otherwise to any subsidiaries or affiliates thereof, or to any other party, in
            connection with a sale of the business related to this Agreement or to the Arrangement Agreement.
            Any assignment of this Agreement by Business Associate in connection with a sale of this business
            shall relieve Business Associate from any further liability hereunder. None of the provisions of
            this Agreement are intended to create, nor will they be deemed to create any relationship between
            the Parties other than that of independent parties contracting with each other solely for the purposes
            of effecting the provisions of this Agreement and any other agreements between the Parties evidencing
            their business relationship. This Agreement will be governed by California law, without regard to
            its choice of law provisions. No change, waiver or discharge of any liability or obligation hereunder
            on any one or more occasions shall be deemed a waiver of performance of any continuing or other obligation,
            or shall prohibit enforcement of any obligation, on any other occasion. In the event that any provision
            of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
            remainder of the provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. In addition,
            in the event a Party believes in good faith that any provision of this Agreement fails to comply
            with the then-current requirements of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, including any then-current
            requirements of the HITECH Act or its regulations, such Party shall notify the other Party in writing.
            For a period of up to thirty (30) days, the Parties shall address in good faith such concern and
            amend the terms of this Agreement, if necessary to bring it into compliance. If, after such thirty
            (30)-day period, the Agreement fails to comply with the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, including
            the HITECH Act, then either Party has the right to terminate upon written notice to the other Party.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimum Requirements.</h3>
        <p>
            The Parties agree that, in the event that any documentation of the Arrangement Agreement pursuant to which Business Associate
            provides services to Covered Entity contains provisions relating to the use or disclosure of Protected
            Health Information that are more restrictive than the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions
            of the more restrictive documentation will control. The provisions of this Agreement are intended
            to establish the minimum requirements regarding the Parties&#8217; use and disclosure of Protected
            Health Information.
